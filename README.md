# 3D Printed Plenum for Cold Gas Propulsion
CAD model and description of 3D-printed plenum volume used in the development of a highly reliable cold gas propulsion system.

The plenum assembly (shown below) consists of the following components:
- 2x Plenum halves (yellow), (PLA, 0.35 mm diamater nozzle at 0.2 mm layer height)
- 1x 44 mm OD x 2 mm Nitrile O-ring
- 1x 44.5 mm ID O-ring holder, (PLA, 0.35 mm diamater nozzle at 0.2 mm layer height)
- 2x M5-to-1/8" threaded barbed fitting 
- 8x M2 x 0.4 x 16 mm SHCS
- 16x M2 flat washer
- 8x M2 x 0.4 hex nut

The plenum halves are printed dome-side up with necessary support structure. Each plenum half is processed after printing with a round of sanding and epoxying, outlined as follows:

- Coarse sanding the inside with 100-grit sandpaper
- Marking orientation of plenum to M5-to-1/8" fitting to ensure final assembly is correctly aligned
- Mixing 2-part epoxy (Bob Smith Industries 30 minute slow-cure epoxy was used)
- Applying 2-part epoxy to interior of plenum with fitting held in place
- Allowing 24 hours for epoxy to cure
- Fine sanding the sealing surface with 400-grit sandpaper
- Finishing the sealing surface with wet sanding using 2000-grit wet sandpaper

Using a set of alignment jigs to hold the barbed fittings in place, the plenum assemblies could be sat dome-side down and allow the epoxy to pool to some degree at the bottom, further adhering the barbed fitting to the plenum structure and creating a strong, air-tight sealing surface. Once curing and wet sanding has taken place, the plenum can be assembled and pressurized.

The plenum was designed to operate nominally at 100 psi and was designed with a factor of safety of approximately 2.4. Multiple laboratory tests successfully held pressure at 200 psig (the maximum output of the regulator in use at the time). Eight full plenum assemblies were constructed with only one plenum half failing during proof testing.
